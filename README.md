About SurvSig
SurvSig is an interactive web application designed for clinicians and researchers working with neuroendocrine lung tumors (SCLC, LCNEC, carcinoid tumors). It enables users to analyze complex gene signatures and explore their relationship with patient outcomes.

Key Features
âœ” Easy-to-use web interface â€“ No coding or bioinformatics expertise required.
âœ” Supports multiple datasets, including:

Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC): George-SCLC, Liu-SCLC, Lissa-SCLC, Jiang-SCLC
Large-Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (LCNEC): George-LCNEC
Carcinoid Tumors: Alcala-Carcinoid, Fernandez-Carcinoid
Mixed Cohort Data: Rousseaux Lung Tumors, TCGA âœ” Gene signature-based analysis â€“ Upload your own gene list or use predefined signatures.
âœ” Advanced visualization tools, including heatmaps, UMAP clustering, and survival curves.
